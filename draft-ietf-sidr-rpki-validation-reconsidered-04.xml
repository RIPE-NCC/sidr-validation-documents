    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document proposes an update to the certificate
      validation procedure specified in <xref target="RFC6487" /> that
      reduces aspects of operational fragility in the management of
      certificates in the RPKI, while retaining essential security
      features.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Certificate Validation in the RPKI">
    
      <t>As currently defined in section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC6487" />,
      validation of PKIX certificates that conform to the RPKI
      profile relies on the use of a path validation process where
      each certificate in the validation path is required to meet the
      certificate validation criteria.</t>
      
      <t>These criteria require in particular that the resources on each
      certificate in the validation path are “encompassed” by the
      resources on the issuing certificate. The first certificate in
      the path is required to be a trust anchor, and its resources are
      considered valid by definition.</t>

      <t>For example, in the following sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
    Issuer TA,
    Subject TA,
    Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
              2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

  Certificate 2: 
   Issuer TA,
   Subject CA1,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

  Certificate 3: 
   Issuer CA1,
   Subject CA2,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

  ROA 1:
   Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): 
    Issuer CA2,
    Subject R1,
    Resources 192.0.2.0/24

    Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>All certificates in this scenario are considered valid in that
      the resources on each certificate are encompassed by the issuing
      certificate. ROA1 is valid because the specified prefix is encompassed
      by the embedded EE certificate, as required by <xref target="RFC6482" />.</t>
      
    </section>
      
    <section title="Operational Considerations">
      
      <t>The allocations recorded in the RPKI change as a result of resource
      transfers and some types of operational errors. For example, the CAs
      involved in transfer might choose to modify CA certificates in an order
      that causes some of these certificates to “over-claim” temporarily. It
      may also happen that a child CA does not voluntarily request a shrunk
      resource certificate when resources are being transferred or reclaimed by
      the parent. Furthermore some types of operational errors that may occur
      during management of RPKI databases also may create CA certificates that,
      temporarily, no longer encompass all of the resources in subordinate
      certificates.</t>

      
      <t>Consider the following sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
   Issuer TA,
   Subject TA,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
             2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

  Certificate 2:
   Issuer TA,
   Subject CA1,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

  Certificate 3 (invalid):
   Issuer CA1,
   Subject CA2,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

  ROA 1 (invalid):
   Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): 
    Issuer CA2,
    Subject R1,
    Resources 192.0.2.0/24
   
    Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Here Certificate 2 from the previous example was re-issued by
      TA to CA1 and the prefix 198.51.100.0/24 was removed. However, CA1
      failed to re-issue a new Certificate 3 to CA2. As a result Certificate 3
      is now over-claiming and considered invalid, and by recursion the embedded
      Certificate 4 used for ROA1 is also invalid. And ROA1 is invalid because
      the specified prefix is no longer encompassed by a valid embedded EE
      certificate, as required by <xref target="RFC6482" /></t>
      
      <t>However, it should be noted that ROA1 does not make use of any of the
      address resources that were removed from CA1’s certificate, and thus
      it would be desirable if ROA1 could still be viewed as valid. Technically
      CA1 could re-issue a Certificate 3 to CA2 without 198.51.100.0/24, and
      then ROA1 would be considered valid according to <xref target="RFC6482" />.
      But as long as CA1 does not take this action, ROA1 remains invalid. It
      would be preferable if ROA1 could be considered valid.</t>
              
    </section>
    
    <section title="An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process">
    
      <section title="Verified Resource Set">
      
         <t>The problem described above can be considered as a low probability
         problem today. However the potential impact on routing security
         would be high if an overclaim occurred near the apex of the RPKI
         hierarchy and would invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree located
         below this point.</t>
      
         <t>The changes proposed here to the validation procedure in
      	 <xref target="RFC6487" /> do not change the probability of this problem,
      	 but limit the impact to just the overclaimed resources. This approach 
      	 is intended to avoid causing CA certificates to be treated as
      	 completely invalid as a result of overclaims. However, these changes
      	 are designed to not degrade the security offered by the RPKI.
      	 Specifically, no ROAs or router certificates will be treated as valid
      	 if they contain only resources that are not encompassed by all superior
      	 certificates along a path to a trust anchor.</t>

      	 <t>The way this is achieved conceptually is by maintaining a set of
      	 verified resources for each certificate that is separate from the set
      	 of resources found in the <xref target="RFC3779" /> resource extension
      	 on a certificate.</t>
      	
      </section>
      
      <section title="Changes to existing standards">
      
      <section title="Resource Certificate Path Validation">
        	
    	<t>Step 6 of the Resource Certification Path Validation defined in
    	section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC6487" /> currently has the following on
    	the validation of resources contained in the <xref target="RFC3779" />
    	resource extension of certificates:<list style="symbols">
    		<t>The resource extension data is "encompassed" by the resource
    		extension data contained in a valid certificate where this
    		issuer is the subject (the previous certificate in the context
    		of the ordered sequence defined by the certification path).</t>
    	</list></t>
    	
    	<t>The following is an amended specification to be used in place of this
    	text.<list style="symbols">
    	
    	  <t>The Relying Party MUST keep a Verified Resource Set for the
    	  certificate independent of the RFC3779 extension itself, that is built
    	  up using the following approach:<list style="symbols">
    	  
    	    <t>If the certificate under test is chosen as a Trust Anchor, then
    	    the Verified Resource Set of this certificate is equal to the RFC3779
    	    resource extensions.</t>
    	
    		<t>If the certificate under test not chosen as a Trust Anchor, the
    		Verified Resource Set is found by comparing this certificate to its
    		parent certificate (the previous certificate in the context of the
    		ordered sequence defined by the certification path) in the following
    		way:<list style="symbols">
    		
    		  <t>For any of the resource extensions that use the "inherit"
    		  element as described in sections 2.2.3.5 and 3.2.3.3 of RFC 3779,
    		  the corresponding resources of this type should be taken from the
    		  parent certificate.</t>
    	  			
    	  	  <t>For resource extensions that do no use the "inherit" element,
    	  	  the intersection of the resources on this certificate and the
    	  	  Verified Resource Set of the parent certificate MUST be used. If
    	  	  any resources on this certificate are not encompassed by the
    	  	  Verified Resource Set of the parent certificate, a warning SHOULD
    	  	  be issued to help operators rectify this situation.</t>
    	  	
    	  	  <t>If the Verified Resource Set obtained this way is empty for all
    	  	  resource classes (IPv4, IPv6 and AS), then the certificate MUST be
    	  	  considered invalid.</t>

    	<section title="ROA Validation">
       	
    	<t>Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6482" /> currently has the following
    	text on the validation of resources on a ROA:<list style="symbols">
    	
    	  <t>The IP address delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the
    	  end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA), and each

          defined section 7 of <xref target="RFC6487" /> is used as the first
          step in validation, and a number of additional constraints are
          applied.</t>
          
          <t>We propose that the text of the following two additions:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>The Validated Resource Set of BGPsec Router Certificates MUST NOT
            include IP Resources.</t>
            <t>BGPsec Router Certificates MUST include the AS Resource
            Identifier Delegation extension and all AS resources included on

      <section title="An example">
      
      	<t>Consider the following example under the amended approach:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
   Issuer TA,
   Subject TA,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
             2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500
    
    Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
                           2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500
    Warnings: none

  Certificate 2: 
   Issuer TA,
   Subject CA1,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32, AS64496
   
    Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24,
                           2001:db8::/32, AS64496
    Warnings: none

  Certificate 3: 
   Issuer CA1,
   Subject CA2,
   Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, AS64496
   
    Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496
    Warnings: overclaim for 198.51.100.0/24

  ROA 1 (valid):
   Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
    Issuer CA2,
    Subject R1,
    Resources 192.0.2.0/24

     Verified resources: 192.0.2.0/24
     Warnings: none
     
     Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
    
    ROA1 is considered valid because the prefix matches the Verified
    Resource Set on the embedded EE certificate, as required by
    RFC 6482.

  ROA 2 (invalid):
   Embedded Certificate 5 (EE certificate):
    Issuer CA2,
    Subject R2,
    Resources 198.51.100.0/24

     Verified resources: none
     Warnings: overclaim for 198.51.100.0/24
     
     Prefix 198.51.100.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
    
    ROA2 is considered invalid because the prefix does not match the
    Verified Resource Set on the embedded EE certificate. The amended
    approach therefore cannot lead to ROAs showing up as valid for
    resources that are not verified on the full path from the Trust
    Anchor down to the ROA.
    
  BGPSec Certificate 1 (valid):
   Issuer CA2
   Subject ROUTER-64496
   Resources AS64496
    
    Verified resources: AS64496
    Warnings: none
     
  BGPSec Certificate 2 (invalid):
   Issuer CA2
   Subject ALL-ROUTERS
   Resources AS64496-AS64497
    
    Verified resources: AS64496
    Warnings: overclaim for AS64497 
    
    BGPSec Certificate 2 is considered invalid because not ALL
    resources are part of the Verified Resource Set of this
    certificate. This problem can be mitigated by issuing separate
    certificates for each AS number.
