    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document proposes and alternative to the certificate
      validation procedure specified in RFC6487 that reduces aspects of
      operational fragility in the management of certificates in the
      RPKI.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Certificate Validation in the RPKI">
    
      <t>As currently defined in section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC6487"
      />, validation of PKIX certificates that conform to the RPKI
      profile relies on the use of a path validation process where
      each certificate in the validation path is required to meet the
      certificate validation criteria.</t>
      
      <t>These criteria require in particular that the resources on each
      certificate in the validation path are “encompassed” by the
      resources on the issuing certificate. The first certificate in
      the path is required to be a trust anchor, and its resources are
      considered valid by definition.</t>

      <t>For example, in the following sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
   Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

  Certificate 2: 
   Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

  Certificate 3: 
   Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

  ROA 1:
   Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): 
   Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24

   Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>All certificates in this scenario are considered valid in that
      the resources on each certificate are encompassed by the issuing
      certificate. The roa "ROA1" is also considered valid here in this
      regard - the prefix is encompassed by the embedded EE
      certificate.</t>
      
    </section>
      
    <section title="Operational Considerations">
      
      <t>Resource allocations can change in the RPKI. And this
      can lead to situations where an "over-claiming" certificate is
      introduced.</t>
      <t>Consider the following sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
   Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

  Certificate 2:
   Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24

  Certificate 3:
   Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

  ROA 1:
   Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): 
   Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24
   
   Prefix 192.168.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Here Certificate 2 from the previous example was re-issued by
      TA to CA1 and certain AS resources were removed. However, CA1
      failed to re-issue a new Certificate 3 to CA2. As a result
      Certificate 3 is now over-claiming and considered invalid, and
      by recursion ROA1 issued by CA2 is also invalid.</t>
      
      <t>It should be noted that CA2 is not claiming any resources on
      ROA1 that it cannot receive on a new Certificate 3. If CA1 would
      only re-issue a Certificate 3 without the AS resources to CA2,
      then ROA1 would be considered valid without the need for any
      further action by CA2.</t>
      
      <t><xref target="RFC6492" /> describes the protocol for
      provisioning resource certificates. In this protocol new
      resource certificates are always issued by request of a child. If
      that protocol were strictly followed then CA1 would have known
      that its resource set was about to shrink, and it would have known
      that it issued some of those resources to its child CA2.</t>
      
      <t>The protocol currently lacks normative wording on how CAs
      should deal with this situation, but one can imagine amending the
      protocol with normative instructions that would require CA1 to
      refuse to request a certificate with a shrunk resource set until
      all of its children would have requested new shrunk certificates
      where applicable. And that would forbid any parent CA to
      pro-actively re-issue a certificate with shrunk resource set before
      receiving a certificate re-issuance request from its child CA.</t>
      
      <t>In practice such a model is unworkable for the CA higher in the
      path, because it has no control over if and when it can shrink a
      certificate for its children. Therefore higher level CAs will
      pro-actively re-issue shrunk resource certificates when resources
      are no longer validly held by a child.</t>
            
      <t>The question here is whether the impact of such a re-issuance
      should be limited to just the resources that seem to be under
      dispute between TA and CA1, or all resources issued to CA2.</t>
        
    </section>
    
    <section title="An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process">
    
    	<section title="Changes to existing standards">

    		<t>The following is a amended specification of certificate
		    validation as described in section 7.2 item number 6 of certificate
    		validation in <xref target="RFC6487" /> that describes the
    		validation of resources in the RPKI path:<list>
    		
    			<t>The Relying Party MUST keep a set of verified resources for
    			the certificate independent of the RFC3779 extension itself,
    			that is built up using the following approach:<list>
    			
    	  			<t>For any of the resource extensions that use the "inherit"
    	  			element as described in sections 2.2.3.5 and 3.2.3.3 of
    	  			<xref target="RFC3779" />, the corresponding resources of this
    	  			type should be taken from the parent certificate, where this
    	  			issuer is the subject.</t>
    	  			
    	  			<t>For any other resources the intersection of the quoted
    	  			resources on this certificate and the parent certificate
    	  			is kept. If any resources were found on this certificate that
    	  			were not present on the parent certificate a warning SHOULD
    	  			be issued to help operators rectify this situation.</t>
    			</list></t>

	    		<t>If the the set of verified resources obtained this way is
    			empty, then the certificate MUST be considered invalid.</t>
    		</list></t>
    
    		<t>Note that if this approach would be used in the example we cite
    		in section 3 of this document, Certificate 3 would have a verified
    		resource set that contains only "192.0.2.0/24", and a warning would
    		be issued with regards to resources "AS64496-AS64500". ROA1 would be
    		considered valid because the quoted prefix was also part of the
    		verified resource set of the embedded Certificate 4.</t>
    		
    	</section>
    	
    	<section title="An example">

			<t>Consider the following example under the amended approach:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
   Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500
    
    Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500
    Warnings: none

  Certificate 2: 
   Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24
   
    Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24
    Warnings: none

  Certificate 3: 
   Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.168.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500
   
    Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24
    Warnings: overclaim for AS64496-AS64500

  ROA 1:
   Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate):
   Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.168.2.0/24

    Verified resources: 192.168.2.0/24
    Warnings: none
     
    Prefix 192.168.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
    
    ROA1 is considered valid because the prefix matches the verified
    resources on the embedded EE certificate.

  ROA 2:
   Embedded Certificate 5 (EE certificate):
   Issuer CA2, Subject R2, Resources 192.168.3.0/24

    Verified resources: none
    Warnings: overclaim for 192.168.3.0/24
     
    Prefix 192.168.3.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
    
    ROA2 is considered invalid because the prefix does not
    match the verified resources on the embedded EE certificate.
    The amended approach cannot lead to ROAs showing up as valid
    for resources that are not verified on the full path from the
    Trust Anchor down to the ROA.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
      <t>The problem described in section 3 of this document has not
      occurred to date. So one could consider this a low probability
      problem today. However the potential impact on routing security
      would be high if the inconsistency occurred near the apex of the RPKI
      hierarchy and would invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree located
      below the point of this inconsistency.</t>
      
      <t>The proposed process does not change the probability of this
      problem, but it limits the impact to just the resources that are
      under dispute. As far as the authors can see there are no real new
      problems introduced by this approach.</t>
      
      <t>It should be noted that although this is a problem with
      a low probability today this is largely due to the fact that most current
      RPKI systems use their own Trust Anchor and do not support any large
      number of delegated CAs. If this changes and the issuance and publication
      of a certificate, by the parent, and its use, by a child, are handled
      by different organisations more commonly, then the probability of this
      problem will increase.</t>
