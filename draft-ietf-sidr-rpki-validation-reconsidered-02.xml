      <t>This document reviews the certificate validation procedure
      specified in RFC6487 and highlights aspects of
      operational fragility in the management of certificates.</t>


    </section>
    <section title="Certificate Validation in the RPKI">

      <t>As currently defined in section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC6487"
      />, validation of PKIX certificates that conform to the RPKI
      profile relies on the use of a path validation process where
      each certificate in the validation path is required to meet the
      certificate validation criteria. This is a recursively defined
      validation process where, in the context of an ordered sequence
      of certificates, as defined by each pair of certificates in this
      sequence having a common Issuer and Subject Name respectively, a
      certificate is defined as valid if it satisfies basic validation
      criteria relating to the syntactic correctness, currency of
      validity dates and similar properties of the certificate itself,
      as described in <xref target="RFC5280" />, and also that it
      satisfies certain additional criteria with respect to the
      previous certificate in the sequence (the Issuer part of the
      pair), and that this previous certificate is itself a valid
      certificate using the same criteria. This process is applied to
      all certificates in the sequence apart from the initial sequence
      element, which is required to be a Trust Anchor.</t>

      <t>For RPKI certificates, the additional criteria relating to
      the previous certificate in this sequence is that the
      certificate's number resource set, as defined in <xref
      target="RFC3779" />, is "encompassed" by the number resource set
      contained in the previous certificate.</t>

      <t>Because <xref target="RFC6487" /> validation demands that all
      resources in a certificate be valid under the parent (and
      recursively, to the root), a digitally signed attestation, such
      as a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) object <xref
      target="RFC6482" />, which refers only to a subset of
      RFC3779-specified resources from that certificate validation
      chain can be concluded to be invalid, but not by virtue of the
      relationship between the RFC3779 extensions of the certificates
      on the putative certificate validation path and the resources in
      the ROA, but by other resources described in these certificates
      where the "encompassing" relationship of the resources does not
      hold.  Any such invalidity along the certificate validation chain
      can cause this outcome, not just at the immediate parent of the
      end entity certificate that attests to the key used to sign the
      ROA.</t>

      <t>For example, in the certificate sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
  Certificate 1:
    Issuer A, Subject B, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, AS64496-AS64500

  Certificate 2: 
    Issuer B, Subject C, Resources 192.0.2.0/24/24, AS64496-AS64511

  Certificate 3: 
    Issuer C, Subject D, Resources 192.0.2.0/24
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Certificate 3 is considered to be an invalid certificate,
      because the resources in Certificate 2 are not encompassed by
      the resources in Certificate 1, by virtue of certificate 2
      describing the resources of the range AS64501 - AS64511 in this
      RFC3779 resource extension. Obviously, these Autonomous Systems
      numbers are not related to the IPv4 resources contained in
      Certificate 3.</t>
      
      <t>Any non-encompassed resource set can cause this form or
      validation failure, whether it is an ASN, IPv4 or IPv6 resource,
      if it is not encompassed by the resource set in the parent
      (Issuer) certificate.</t>

      <t>The underlying observation here is that this definition of
      certificate validation treats a collection of resources as
      inseparable, so that a single certificate containing a bundle of
      number resources is semantically distinct from an equivalent set
      of certificates where each certificate contains a single number
      resource. This semantic distinction between the whole and the
      sum of its parts is an artifice introduced by the particular
      choice of a certificate validation procedure used by the RPKI,
      as distinct from meeting any particular operational requirement,
      and the result is the introduction of operational fragility into
      the handling of RPKI certificates, particularly in the case
      where number resources are moved between the corresponding
      registries, as described here.</t>
      
    </section>
    <section title="Operational Considerations">

      <t>There are two areas of operational concern with the current
      RPKI validation definition.</t>

      <t>The first is that of the robustness of the operational
      management procedures in the issuance of certificates. If a
      subordinate Certification Authority (CA) issues a certificate
      that contains an Internet Number Resource (INR) collection that
      is not either exactly equal to, or a strict subset of, its
      parent CA, then this issued certificate, and all subordinate
      certificates of this issued certificate are invalid. These
      certificates are not only defined as invalid when being
      considered to validate an INR that is not in the parent CA
      certificate, but are defined as invalid for all INRs in the
      certificate.</t>

     <t>This constraint creates a degree of operational fragility in
     the issuance of certificates, as all CA's are now required to
     exercise extreme care in the issuance and reissuance of
     certificates to ensure that at no time do they overclaim on the
     resources described in the parent CA, as the consequences of an
     operational lapse or oversight implies that all the subordinate
     certificates from the point of INR mismatch are invalid. It would
     be preferred if the consequences of such an operational lapse
     were limited in scope to the specific INRs that formed the
     mismatch, rather than including the entire set of INRs within the
     scope of damage from this point of mismatch downward across the
     entire sub-tree of descendant certificates in the RPKI
     certificate hierarchy.</t>

      <t>The second operational consideration described here relates
      to the situation where a registry withdraws a resource from the
      current holder, and the resource to transferred to another
      registry, to be registered to a new holder in that registry. The
      reason why this is a consideration in operational deployments of
      the RPKI lies in the movement of the "home" registry of number
      resources during cases of mergers, acquisitions, business
      re-alignments, and resource transfers and the desire to ensure
      that during this movement all other resources can continue to be
      validated.</t>

      <t>If the original registry's certification actions are simply
      to issue a new certificate for the current holder with a reduced
      resource set, and to revoke the original certificate, then there
      is a distinct possibility of encountering the situation
      illustrated by the example in the previous section. This is a
      result of an operational process for certificate issuance by the
      parent CA being de-coupled from the certificate operations of
      child CA.</t>

      <t>This de-coupled operation of CAs introduces a risk of
      unintended third party damage: since a CA certificate can refer
      to holdings which relate to two or more unrelated subordinate
      certificates, if this CA certificate becomes invalid due to the
      reduction in the resources allocated to this CA relating to one
      subordinate resource set, all other subordinate certificates are
      invalid until the CA certificate is reissued with a reduced
      resource set.</t>

      <t>In the example provided in the previous section, all
      subordinate certificates issued by CA B are invalid, including
      all certificates issued by CA C, until CA A issues a new
      certificate for CA B with a reduced resource set.</t>

      <t>At the lower levels of the RPKI hierarchy the resource sets
      affected by such movements of resources may not encompass
      significantly large pools of resources. However, as one ascends
      through this certification hierarchy towards the apex, the
      larger the resource set that is going to be affected by a period
      of invalidity by virtue of such uncoordinated certificate
      management actions. In the case of a Regional Internet Registry
      (RIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR), the potential risk
      arising from uncoordinated certification actions relating to a
      transfer of resources is that the entire set of subordinate
      certificates that refer to resources administered by the RIR or
      the NIR cannot be validated during this period.</t>

      <t>Avoiding such situations requires that CA's adhere to a very
      specific ordering of certificate issuance. In this framework,
      the common registry CA that describes (directly or indirectly)
      the resources being shifted from one registry to the other, and
      also contains in subordinate certificates (direct or indirect)
      the certificates for both registries who are parties to the
      resource transfer has to coordinate a specific sequence of
      actions.</t>

      <t>This common registry CA has to first issue a new certificate
      towards the "receiving" registry that adds to the RFC3779
      extension resource set the specific resource being transferred
      into this receiving registry. The common registry CA then has to
      wait until all registries in the subordinate certificate chain
      to the receiving registry have also performed a similar issuance
      of new certificates, and in each case a registry must await the
      issuance of the immediate superior certificate with the
      augmented resource set before it, in turn, can issue its own
      augmented certificate to its subordinate CA. This is a "top
      down" issuance sequence."</t>

      <t>It is possible for the common registry to issue a certificate
      to the "sending" registry with the reduced resource set at any
      time, but it should not revoke the previously issued
      certificate, nor overwrite this previously issued certificate in
      its repository publication point without specific
      coordination. Only when the common registry is assured that the
      top down certificate issuance process to the receiving registry
      CA chain has been completed can the common registry commence the
      revocation of the original certificate for the sending registry,
      However, it should not so until it is assured that the immediate
      subordinate registry CA in the path to the sending registry has
      issued a certificate with a reduced resource set, and so
      on. This implies that on the sending side the certificate
      issuance and revocation is a "bottom up" process.</t>

      <t>If this process is not carefully followed, then the risk is
      that some or all or the subordinate certificates of this common
      registry CA will be unable to be validated until the entire
      process of certificate issuance and revocation has been
      completed. While this sequenced process is intended to preserve
      validity of certificates in the RPKI, it is a complex, fragile
      and operationally cumbersome process.</t>
  
      <t>The underlying consideration here is that the operational
      coordination of these certificate issuance and revocation
      actions to effect a smooth resource transfer across registries
      is mandated by the nature of the particular choice of
      certificate validation process described in <xref
      target="RFC6487" />.</t>

   </section>
   <section title="Alternative Approaches">

     <t>If the current definition of the RPKI certificate validation
     procedure is considered to introduce unacceptable levels of
     fragility and risk into the operational environment, what
     alternatives exist?</t>
     
     <t>One approach is to remove the semantic requirement to consider
     the collection of resources in the extension field of the RPKI
     certificate as an indivisible bundle. This would allow for a
     certificate to be considered as valid for some subset of the
     resources listed in this extension, without necessarily being
     considered as valid for all such described resources. The
     implications of this approach is that any mismatch between parent
     and subordinate over resources where the subordinate certificate
     lists resources that are not contained in the parent certificate
     would affect validity questions relating to only those particular
     resources, rather than invaliding the subordinate certificate for
     all resources, and all of its subordinate products. This would
     appear to offer a relatively precise alignment to the defined
     problem space, and limits the scope of consequent third party
     damage in the event of a INR mismatch within the RPKI
     certification hierarchy.</t>
     
     <t>Another approach may involve the alteration of the RPKI
     provisioning protocol <xref target="RFC6492" /> to include a
     specific signal from child to parent ("bottom up") relating to
     readiness for certificate revocation.  At this stage it is
     entirely unclear how this signalling mechanism would operate, nor
     is it clear that it would alter the elements of operational
     fragility nor mitigate to any meaningful extent the risks of
     failure to ensure strict INR consistency at all times.  This is a
     topic for further study.</t>
     
    </section>
    <section title="An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process">

    <t>The following is a amended specification of certificate
    validation as described in <xref target="RFC6487" /> that
    describes an amended RPKI certificate validation process that was
    informally outlined in the previous section.</t>

    <t>Validation of signed resource data using a signing key that is
    certified in a resource certificate, coupled with a specific set
    of number resources, consists of verifying that the digital
    signature of the signed resource data is valid, using the public
    key that is certified by the resource certificate, and also
    validating the resource certificate in the context of the RPKI,
    using the path validation process.</t>

    <t>This path validation process verifies, among other things, that
    a prospective certification path (a sequence of n certificates)
    satisfies the following conditions: <vspace blankLines="1" />
    <list> <t><list style="numbers">

      <t>for all 'x' in {1, ..., n-1}, the Subject of certificate 'x'
      is the Issuer of certificate ('x' + 1); 
      <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

      <t>certificate '1' is issued by a trust anchor;
      <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>certificate 'n' is the certificate to be validated; and
      <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>for all 'x' in {1, ..., n}, certificate 'x' is valid for the
      specific set of resources.</t>

      </list></t>
    </list></t>

    <t>RPKI validation for a specific set of resources entails
    verifying that all of the following conditions hold, in addition
    to the Certification Path Validation criteria specified in Section
    6 of <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>: <vspace blankLines="1" />
    <list><t><list style="numbers">

      <t>The certificate can be verified using the Issuer's public key
      and the signature algorithm <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>The current time lies within the certificate's Validity From
      and To values. <vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>The certificate contains all fields that MUST be present, as
      specified by <xref target="RFC6487" />, and contains values for
      selected fields that are defined as allowable values by this
      specification.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>No field, or field value, that the <xref target="RFC6487" />
      specification defines as MUST NOT be present is used in the
      certificate.<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>The Issuer has not revoked the certificate. A revoked
      certificate is identified by the certificate's serial number
      being listed on the Issuer's current CRL, as identified by the
      CRLDP of the certificate, the CRL is itself valid, and the
      public key used to verify the signature on the CRL is the same
      public key used to verify the certificate itself.<vspace
      blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>The resource extension data contained in this certificate
      "encompasses" the entirety of the resources in the specific
      resource set ("encompass" in this context is defined in Section
      7.1 of <xref target="RFC6487" />).<vspace blankLines="1" /></t>

      <t>The Certification Path originates with a certificate issued
      by a trust anchor, and there exists a signing chain across the
      Certification Path where the Subject of Certificate 'x' in the
      Certification Path matches the Issuer in Certificate 'x + 1' in
      the Certification Path, and the public key in Certificate 'x'
      can verify the signature value in Certificate 'x+1'.</t>
      </list></t> </list></t>

    <t>A certificate validation algorithm MAY perform these tests in
    any chosen order.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
      <t>The Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC6487" /> and
      <xref target="RFC6492" /> do not address the topic described
      here.  Obviously, within the current RPKI validation procedure,
      any inconsistency in certificates located towards the apex of
      the RPKI hierarchy would invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree
      located below the point of this inconsistency. If the RPKI was
      used to control inter-domain routing in the context of a secure
      routing protocol, then the implications of this large scale
      invalidation of certificates would have a corresponding massive
      impact on the stability of routing. This appears to be a serious
      situation.</t>
