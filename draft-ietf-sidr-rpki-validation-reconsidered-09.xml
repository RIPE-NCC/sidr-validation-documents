<abstract>

<t>This document specifies an alternative to the certificate
validation procedure specified in RFC 6487 that
reduces aspects of operational fragility in the management of
certificates in the RPKI, while retaining essential security
features.</t>

<t>Where the procedure specified in RFC 6487 requires that Resource
Certificates are rejecting entirely if they are found to over-claim any resources not
contained on the issuing certificate, the validation process defined
here allows an issuing Certificate Authority to chose to communicate
that such Resource Certificates should be accepted for the intersection
of their resources and the issuing certificate.</t>

<t>This choice is signalled by form of a set of alternative Object Identifiers (OIDs) of
RFC 3779 X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers, and certificate policy for
the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RFC 6484). It should be noted that in case these
OIDs are not used for any certificate under a Trust Anchor, the validation procedure
defined here has the same outcome as the procedure defined in RFC 6487</t>

<t>Furthermore this document provides an alternative to ROA (RFC 6482), and BGPSec Router
Certificate (BGPSec PKI Profiles - publication requested) validation.</t>

  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",

</section>

<section title="Certificate Validation in the RPKI">

<t>As currently defined in section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC6487" />,
validation of PKIX certificates that conform to the RPKI
profile relies on the use of a path validation process where
each certificate in the validation path is required to meet the
certificate validation criteria.</t>

<t>These criteria require, in particular, that the Internet Number
Resources (INRs) of each certificate in the validation path are
“encompassed” by INRs on the issuing certificate. The first certificate in
the path is required to be a trust anchor, and its resources are
considered valid by definition.</t>

<t>For example, in the following sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
Issuer TA,
Subject TA,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
      2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

Certificate 2: 
Issuer TA,
Subject CA1,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

Certificate 3: 
Issuer CA1,
Subject CA2,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

ROA 1:
Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): 
Issuer CA2,
Subject R1,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24

Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>All certificates in this scenario are considered valid since the INRs
of each certificate are encompassed by those of the issuing certificate.
ROA1 is valid because the specified prefix is encompassed by the embedded
EE certificate, as required by <xref target="RFC6482" />.</t>

</section>

<section title="Operational Considerations">

<t>The allocations recorded in the RPKI change as a result of resource
transfers. For example, the CAs involved in transfer might choose to 
modify CA certificates in an order that causes some of these certificates
to “over-claim” temporarily. A certificate is said to “over-claim” if it
includes INRs not contained in the INRs of the CA that issued the
certificate in question.</t>
<t>It may also happen that a child CA does not voluntarily request a
shrunk resource certificate when resources are being transferred or
reclaimed by the parent. Furthermore operational errors that may occur
during management of RPKI databases also may create CA certificates that,
temporarily, no longer encompass all of the INRs of subordinate
certificates.</t>

<t>Consider the following sequence:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
Certificate 1 (trust anchor):
Issuer TA,
Subject TA,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24,
     2001:db8::/32, AS64496-AS64500

Certificate 2:
Issuer TA,
Subject CA1,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

Certificate 3 (invalid):
Issuer CA1,
Subject CA2,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32

ROA 1 (invalid):
Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate, invalid): 
Issuer CA2,
Subject R1,
Resources 192.0.2.0/24

Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Here Certificate 2 from the previous example was re-issued by
TA to CA1 and the prefix 198.51.100.0/24 was removed. However, CA1
failed to re-issue a new Certificate 3 to CA2. As a result Certificate 3
is now over-claiming and considered invalid; by recursion the embedded
Certificate 4 used for ROA1 is also invalid. And ROA1 is invalid because
the specified prefix contained in the ROA is no longer encompassed by a
valid embedded EE certificate, as required by <xref target="RFC6482" /></t>

<t>However, it should be noted that ROA1 does not make use of any of the
address resources that were removed from CA1’s certificate, and thus
it would be desirable if ROA1 could still be viewed as valid. Technically
CA1 should re-issue a Certificate 3 to CA2 without 198.51.100.0/24, and
then ROA1 would be considered valid according to <xref target="RFC6482" />.
But as long as CA1 does not take this action, ROA1 remains invalid. It
would be preferable if ROA1 could be considered valid, since the assertion
it makes was not affected by the reduced scope of CA1’s certificate.</t>
      
</section>

<section title="An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process">

<section title="Verified Resource Sets">

 <t>The problem described above can be considered as a low probability
 problem today. However the potential impact on routing security
 would be high if an over-claiming occurred near the apex of the RPKI
 hierarchy, as this would invalidate the entirety of the sub-tree
 located below this point.</t>

 <t>The changes specified here to the validation procedure in
 <xref target="RFC6487" /> do not change the probability of this
 problem, but they do limit the impact to just the over-claimed
 resources. This revised validation algorithm is intended to avoid
 causing CA certificates to be treated as completely invalid as a result
 of over-claims. However, these changes are designed to not degrade the
 security offered by the RPKI. Specifically, ROAs and router
 certificates will be treated as valid only if all of the resources
 contained in them are encompassed by all superior certificates along a
 path to a trust anchor.</t>

 <t>The way this is achieved conceptually is by maintaining a Verified
 Resource Set (VRS) for each certificate that is separate from the INRs
 found in the <xref target="RFC3779" /> resource extension in the
 certificate.</t>

</section>

<section title="Differences with existing standards">

<section title="Certificate Policy (CP) for use with validation reconsidered in the Resource PKI (RPKI)" anchor="amended_validation_policy">

<t>Note that section 1.2 of <xref target="RFC6484" /> defines the "Certificate Policy
   (CP) for the Resource PKI (RPKI)" with the following OID:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[ 
id-cp-ipAddr-asNumber OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
        identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
        security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) cp(14) 2 }

<t>This document requests an assignment of a new OID for an alternative "Certificate Policy
   (CP) for use with validation reconsidered in the Resource PKI (RPKI)" as follows:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

        security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) cp(14) TBD1 }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This alternative Certificate Policy is the same as the Certificate Policy described in

   of the validation procedure described in <xref target="reconsidered_path_validation" />.</t>

      <section title="Amended Resource Certificate Path Validation" anchor="reconsidered_path_validation">

        <t>The following is an amended specification for path validation to be used in
        place of section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC6487" /> allowing for the validation of
        both certificates following the profile defined in <xref target="RFC6487" />, as
        well as certificates following the profile described above.</t>
        
        <t>The following algorithm is employed to validate CA and EE resources
        certificates. It is modelled on the path validation algorithm from
        <xref target="RFC5280" />, but modified to make use of the IP Address
        Delegation and AS Identifier Delegation Extensions from
        <xref target="RFC3779" />.</t>
        
        <t>There are two inputs to the validation algorithm:<list style="numbers">
            <t>a trust anchor</t>
            <t>a certificate to be validated</t>
        </list></t>
        
        <t>The algorithm is initialized with two new variables for use in the
        RPKI: Validated Resource Set-IP (VRS-IP) and Validated Resource Set-AS
        (VRS-AS). These sets are used to track the set of INRs (IP address
        space and AS Numbers) that are considered valid for each CA certificate.
        The VRS-IP and VRS-AS sets are initially set to the IP Address
        Delegation and AS Identifier Delegation values, respectively, from the
        trust anchor used to perform validation.</t>
        
        <t>This path validation algorithm verifies, among other things, that a
        prospective certification path (a sequence of n certificates) satisfies
        the following conditions:<list style="letters">
        
            <t>for all 'x' in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate 'x' is the
            issuer of certificate ('x' + 1);</t>
            
            <t>certificate '1' is issued by a trust anchor;</t>
            
            <t>certificate 'n' is the certificate to be validated; and</t>
            
            <t>for all 'x' in {1, ..., n}, certificate 'x' is valid.</t>
        
        </list></t>
        
        <t>Certificate validation requires verifying that all of the following
        conditions hold, in addition to the certification path validation
        criteria specified in Section 6 of [RFC5280].<list style="numbers">
        
            <t>The signature of certificate x (x>1) is verified using the public
            key of the issuer’s certificate (x-1), using the signature algorithm
            specified for that public key (in certificate x-1).</t>
            
            <t>The current time lies within the interval defined by the
            NotBefore and NotAfter values in the Validity field of certificate
            x.</t>
            
            <t>The Version, Issuer, and Subject fields of certificate x satisfy
            the constraints established in Section 4.1-4.7 of this
            specification.</t>
            
            <t>If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in section 4.8.9 of

               The value(s) for each of these extensions MUST satisfy the constraints
               established for each extension in the respective sections. Any extension not

               except sections 4.8.9, 4.8.10 and 4.8.10 MUST be present. The certificate
               MUST contain an extension as defined in <xref target="amended_6487_ip" /> or
               <xref target="amended_6487_as" />, or both. The value(s) for each of these

               in the respective sections. Any extension not thus identified MUST NOT

            </t>
            
            <t>If there is any difference in resources in the VRS-IP and the IP
            Address Delegation extension on certificate x, or the VRS-AS and the

        <t>These rules allow a CA certificate to contain resources that are not
        present in (all of) the certificates along the path from the trust
        anchor to the CA certificate. If none of the resources in the CA
        certificate are present in all certificates along the path, no
        subordinate certificates could be valid. However, the certificate is not
        immediately rejected as this may be a transient condition. Not
        immediately rejecting the certificate does not result in a security
        problem because the associated VRS sets accurately reflect the resources
        validly associated with the certificate in question.</t>

       <t>Because this document introduces new OIDs and an alternative the Profile for
       X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates described in <xref target="RFC6487" />, the use
       of such certificates in the global RPKI will lead to the rejection of such
       certificates by Relying Party tools that do not (yet) implement the alternative
       profile described in this document.</t>
       
       <t>For this reason it is important that such tools are updated before Certificate
       Authorities start to use this specification.</t>
       
       <t>However, because the choice of algorithm is well-defined for each
       certificate and/or RPKI signed object, there is no strict requirement for
       all Certificate Authorities to migrate to this new algorithm within a
       specific time period. The choice to opt-in to this can be made by each CA
       independently. CAs MAY also choose to use the new algorithm for new
       certificates or objects only, without pro-actively re-issuing existing
       objects - for example because the latter would require an active
       authorisation by a user of the system.</t>
